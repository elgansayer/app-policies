# Privacy Policy for [App Name]

**Last Updated:** [Date]

## 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how "[App Name]" (the "Application"), a personal tool developed and used solely by [Your Name/Elgan] (the "User"), handles data. As this application is for personal use only, data handling is minimal and primarily involves the User's own information required to interact with third-party services like the TikTok API.

## 2. Data Collection and Use
The Application requires the following information, provided directly by the User (developer) during authorisation or configuration:

* **API Credentials:** To interact with the TikTok API, the Application uses credentials (such as Access Tokens, Refresh Tokens, Open ID) obtained through TikTok's official OAuth 2.0 flow, authorised solely by the User for their own account. These credentials are used **only** to authenticate with and make requests to the TikTok API on behalf of the User.
* **User Configuration:** Any settings or inputs the User provides to operate the application (e.g., video file paths for upload).

The Application **does not**:
* Collect personal data from anyone other than the User (developer).
* Track the User's activity through analytics or tracking cookies.
* Collect sensitive personal information beyond what is necessary for API interaction authorised by the User.

Data accessed via the TikTok API (e.g., user profile information, video lists) is done solely on behalf of the User and is **not** stored persistently by this Application, except potentially in temporary memory during operation. [**EDIT THIS** if your app *does* store data - explain what, why, and for how long].

## 3. Data Storage and Security
* API credentials (like Access Tokens) needed for operation are stored securely by the User [**Specify how, e.g., "as environment variables on the User's local machine" or "in a secure local configuration file accessible only to the User"**].
* Reasonable measures are taken to prevent unauthorised access, but absolute security cannot be guaranteed for any system.

## 4. Data Sharing
The Application **does not** share any personal data or credentials with third parties, **except** as necessary to communicate directly with the TikTok API as authorised by the User. No data is sold or shared for marketing or other purposes.

## 5. Data Retention
* API Credentials are retained only as long as configured by the User [**Adjust if applicable, e.g., "and are removed when the User clears the configuration"**].
* Temporary data processed during operation is not retained after the operation completes.

## 6. User Rights
As the sole User and developer, you have full control over:
* Providing or revoking API access credentials via the TikTok platform settings.
* Modifying or deleting the Application and any associated configuration data stored locally.
* Managing your data directly within your TikTok account.

## 7. Changes to this Policy
This policy may be updated periodically. Continued use of the Application after changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.

## 8. Contact
For any questions regarding this policy, please contact [Your Contact Info - Optional, e.g., your email or GitHub profile link].
